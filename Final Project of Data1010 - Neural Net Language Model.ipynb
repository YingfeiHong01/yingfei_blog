    "This is a typical language modeling problem. The goal of **Language modeling (LM)** is to evaluate whether a sentence makes sense in natural language settings by determining a given sequence of words occurring in a sentence using various techniques. There are two primary types of Language models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Statistical language modeling** is a traditional branch of LM that assigns probabilities to the sequences of words and calculates the probabilities of different sentences of which the maximum probability corresponds to the best combination.\n",
    "2. **Neural Language modeling** is a recent trend and has surpassed the statistical language models in their effectiveness. Rather than using the statistical properties, the Neural Language modeling uses neural network architecture to predict the probability of a sequence of words. And the **Feedforward Neural Net Language Model **is the most basic and simplest model in the Neural Language model family.\n",

Compared with the structure of FFNNLM, the RNNLM has two differences: one is that it uses the sigmoid function in the hidden layer rather than the tanh function, the other is that in the input layer, the vector $v$ not only contains the distributed feature vector of the n-1 previous words but also incorporates the output of the hidden layer of the previous RNNLM which is to compute the probability of a word in the i-1th position in a sequence of words as the current RNNLM is to compute the probability of the word in the ith position.

    "The language model is a crucial way for the machine to understand natural languages since each language model type, in one way or another, transforms the qualitative property of the natural language into the quantitative property.

    "- **Speech recognition**. Voice assistants like Siri or Alexa and AI agents in customer service are the common application of language models that transform audio information into something quantitative features that machines are able to process.\n",

    "- **Sentiment Analysis**. It has been widely used in e-commerce. The main goal of sentiment analysis is to understand the opinions and attitudes expressed in a text. As there are a large number of product reviews on e-commerce platforms like Amazon or eBay, people running businesses on these platforms can use the sentiment analysis technique to analyze customers' attitudes and find ways to improve customer experience and thus increase their profits.\n",
